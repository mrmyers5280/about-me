		<h2>Who I Am</h2>
		<p>I am an entry-level front-end web developer who gets <em>giddy</em> at the thought of using code to make and change elements on web pages. I have a broad range of professional experience and skills ranging from desktop trouble-shooting to the ability to hand code <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
		<p>I love learning, especially learning about web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm enrolled in the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Front End Career Path at Thinkful</a> and I'm learning a lot. You can see some of my work below.</p>
		<p>I volunteer with a local conservation organization that does river and trail repair as well as offering monthly presenters on related topics. Additionally, I manage their WordPress website as well as creating content for the site.</p>
